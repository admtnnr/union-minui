**Extras**

-------------------------------

hardware rev
	volumn and menu buttons no longer work
	headphone jack detection no longer works
	booting doesn't work reliably
	
	all of the above works fine on stock firmware
	eggs cooked up ways to 
		under/overclock the cpu and 
		access more physical memory for the framebuffer 
	on unmodified stock :tada:

minarch
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
		Boost FF Off|On
			Prioritize speed when fast forwarding by disabling tearing prevention and increasing CPU speed.
			
			SFC (2x with) (Star Fox still only hits 1.5x with)
			MGBA (2x with) (SGB is fine without)
			FC (2x without, 2.66x with)
			PS (depends on game, without FFVII gets 4x, SotN only 2x, Tekken 3 just crashes)
			SUPA (Starfox 1.5x with)
			VB (can't be helped, already needs Performance)
	
	can I support changing discs in multi-disc pbps?
	
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
		
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up
		I should probably rewrite the entire render pipeline now that I better understand
		the requirements for resolution independence...
		and because I'll need a self-contained implementation to be able to address the unique quirks of each platform I want to support

add most recent uImage/kernel changes
	wait till things settle
	keep an eye on gpu work
		not interested in tripling boot time for gpu access
		I would never pick up the device again if it took that long to boot

hdmi
	I might this off as a novelty
		it's a distraction
		my time is better spent unionizing this for the Mini
	minarch menu
		need to figure out how to create a 4:3 thumb from a distorted framebuffer
		should be able to reconstruct it with screen->w|h and renderer.(src|dst)_(w|h)
			just need to downsample to a cropped region of the source
			or keep the libretro buffer data and use that to create the snapshot and resized backing
				
	audio
		the following works if we boot with hdmi attached but hangs/crashes when we disconnect hdmi
			I imagine the crash is because SDL is trying to write to a device that is no longer present
			the hang is the result of the audio callback stopping maybe?
			no, it's hanging in SDL_CloseAudio()
				could this have something to do with env vars?
				eggs had a similar crash with another (something like NO BLANK ON QUIT) flag
		
			if (GetHDMI()) SDL_putenv("AUDIODEV=plughw:0,1");
			else SDL_putenv("AUDIODEV=default");
		
	usb contollers
	prevent sleep (auto or manual) when on hdmi
		should show a message saying sleep is disabled on hdmi or
		turn off mirroring while asleep
		I still think sleep on HDMI is a bad idea unless connected to power...


create a clean image to flash and install over
	advanced users seem to be confused about how simple it is tow install :sweat_smile:
	this might be difficult with the gpio revs on newer devices


minui
	- 

misc
	port Random Game.pak + daemon
	port say, show, blank, and confirm
	make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

checkout eggs tools
	I wonder if I could patch in Commander-11, BPreplayBold is too bold at that size

cores
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the framerate
		conversely aspect runs terrible on hdmi (~45fps) but native runs fine
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken 3 freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding after a while

	cave story
		would need to set up disabling autosleep and 
		warning about lack of autosave and 
		update ui for lack of save states, etc
	
	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

makefile
	-
	
sdl
	-

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
